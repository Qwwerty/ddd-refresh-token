# ðŸ§© Domain-Driven Design (DDD) with Refresh Token

This project was built to study and apply **Domain-Driven Design (DDD)** principles in a practical scenario involving **authentication and refresh tokens**.

The goal is to demonstrate how to structure an application following the principles of **domain separation**, **rich entities**, **well-defined use cases**, and **repository abstractions** â€” ensuring low coupling and high cohesion between modules.

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Purpose

The main focus of this repository is to understand how DDD can be applied in real-world use cases, particularly for secure **JWT refresh token workflows**.  
Throughout development, the following concepts were explored:

- Creation of domain entities and aggregates  
- Implementation of use cases (`use-cases`)  
- Use of interfaces for infrastructure abstraction (repositories, encryption, etc.)  
- Complete authentication flow with controlled token expiration and refresh logic  

---

## ðŸ§  Key Learnings

- Practical application of Domain-Driven Design (DDD) principles  
- Improved code organization and testability  
- Secure handling of JWT access and refresh tokens  
- Clear separation between domain, application, and infrastructure layers

## ðŸ“¦ Project Structure

The project follows a **Domain-Driven Design (DDD)** architecture, divided into clear and independent layers to promote scalability, maintainability, and testability.

## ðŸ§± Layer Overview

### **Core**
Contains fundamental building blocks and base classes shared across the project.

### **Domain**
The heart of the business logic â€” entities, value objects, and use cases live here.  
This layer is fully independent from frameworks and external libraries.

### **Infra**
Infrastructure implementations (database, JWT, HTTP, etc.) that fulfill contracts defined in the domain layer.

### **Test**
Contains unit and end-to-end (E2E) tests to validate both domain and infrastructure behavior.
